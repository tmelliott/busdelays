# Auckland Bus Delays

A (hopefully) simple app to explore patterns in delays of Auckland
buses. Currently the data\* runs from 2017-04-01 until 2018-03-31.

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/tmelliott/busdelays
cd busdelays
R -e "shiny::runApp()"
```

  - youâ€™ll need to download the data manually. Ask me if you want it.
