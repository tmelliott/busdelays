# Auckland Bus Delays

A (hopefully) simple app to explore patterns in delays of Auckland buses.
Currently the data* runs from `r "2017-04-01"` until `r "2018-03-31"`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tmelliott/busdelays
cd busdelays
R -e "shiny::runApp()"
```

* you'll need to download the data manually. Ask me if you want it.
