# Auckland Bus Delays

A (hopefully) simple app to explore patterns in delays of Auckland buses.
Currently the data runs from `r "2017-04-01"` until `r "2018-03-31"`.


__NOTE__: currently the data is zipped up in the directory so it'll take ages to clone. At some point I'll figure out how to host the database in a cloud somewhere and serve from there.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tmelliott/busdelays
cd busdelays
R -e "shiny::runApp()"
```
